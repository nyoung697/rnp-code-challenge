CARDS.JS
---
I chose JavaScript/React for this exercise because:

 - My most recent projects are React, so it's fresh in my mind
 - The simplicity of working with arrays in JavaScript
 - React (create-react-app) makes building a UI easy, and I figured you'd (the user) want to see a print out of the deck, verify it's being shuffled, and a print out of the "hands" being dealt.


* essentially a component is a class
* create-react-app comes with Jest to run tests

CONSIDERATIONS

 * The description doesn't mention how many "players" or "hands" need to be dealt.  It just says deal one card and potentially all the cards.  I added a setting to specify number of hands to deal.
 * Knuth-Shuffle (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array). Used this initially, rather than re-inventing the wheel, as it was easy to install via npm.  However, I decided to write my own function based on this approach (and this egghead.io video I watched: https://egghead.io/lessons/typescript-create-random-integers-in-a-given-range) 
 * Using nested-loops is fine, as the max iterations is 52, so there are no performance worries.
