CARDS.JS
---
I chose JavaScript/React for this exercise because:

 - My most recent projects are React, so it's fresh in my mind
 - The simplicity of working with arrays in JavaScript
 - React (create-react-app) makes building a UI easy, and I figured you'd (the user) want to see a print out of the deck, verify it's being shuffled, and a print out of the "hands" being dealt.


* essentially a component is a class
* create-react-app comes with Jest to run tests

CONSIDERATIONS

 * The description doesn't mention how many "players" or "hands" need to be dealt.  It just says deal one card and potentially all the cards.  I added a setting in the package.json file to specify number of hands to deal.


* Knuth-Shuffle -- used this rather than re-inventing the wheel.  Easy to install via npm.

* Using nested-loops is fine, as the max iterations is 52, so there are no performance worries.
